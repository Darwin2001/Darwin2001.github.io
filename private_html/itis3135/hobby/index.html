            <h2>What is competitive Pokemon battling?</h2>
            <p>Competitve Pokemon battling stems from the popular kids game Pokemon. Competitve battling is simply
                taking the battling aspect of the game and turning it into a competition, with people all over the world
                training to become better and taking the game to it's limit.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Pokemon battling can be simply broken down into two phases. The trainer and the pokemon. Pokemon being a
                predictive game just as much as a reactionary sometimes it isn't the pokemon that beat you but the
                trainer themselves like in chess. It isn't the pawn or rook that beat you but the player instead. This
                website will cover the pieces themselves, what makes certain pokemon better and what gives them an edge
                over others.</p>

            <h2>Pokemon Types</h2>
            <p>Within pokemon there exists types. These types determine certain movepools for pokemon the but mainly the
                pokemons strengths and weaknesses. Certain strengths are easy to determine like water being strong
                against fire,
                while other can be more difficult to determine.</p>
