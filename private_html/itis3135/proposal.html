        <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>My website is going to serve as an informational website in order to inform people on the benefits of recycling
           while also teaching the correct way to recycle and all the unseen benefits to it. Intended users of the website 
           would be people interested in recycling and the benefits it could offer, that could be anyone old or young, male
           or female.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The content of the website will contain reasons to recycle, what specific numbers with recycling mean and what 
            content can be recycled with what numbers. It will contain images of areas with poor recycling habits and areas
            with high recylcing. It will also contain a form to obtain information to volunteer at nearby recycling plants 
            and highlight areas with good recycling. </p>
