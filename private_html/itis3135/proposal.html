        <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>My website is going to serve as an informational website in order to inform people on the benefits of
            recycling
            while also teaching the correct way to recycle and all the unseen benefits to it. Intended users of the
            website
            would be people interested in recycling and the benefits it could offer, that could be anyone old or young,
            male
            or female.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The content of the website will contain reasons to recycle, what specific numbers with recycling mean and
            what
            content can be recycled with what numbers. It will contain images of areas with poor recycling habits and
            areas
            with high recylcing. It will also contain a form to obtain information to volunteer at nearby recycling
            plants
            and highlight areas with good recycling. </p>
