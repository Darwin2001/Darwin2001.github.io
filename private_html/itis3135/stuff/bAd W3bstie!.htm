    <h2>What is this page about</h2>
    <p>This is an image of a panda, pandas have been around since <u>120 B.C</u> when the Mammoths were walking around.
        The fire nation then began to encroach and only the Avatar master of all four elements could stop them, but when
        the world needed them most they vanished. It's been 100 years and me and my brother Sokka found this panda in
        ice claiming to be the avatar, maybe he can save us all.</p>
    <h1>Who is the avatar?</h1>
    <p class="avatar">The avatar is master of all four elements: Earth, Wind, Fire, and Water. Speaking of Earth, Wind,
        and Fire, september was such a banger. Fun fact I am listening to that song as I am coding that website right
        now. "Aehaha say do you remember, Aehahah dancing in september, never was a cloudy dayyyyyyy.</p>

    <p class="center">Anyways back to what we were talking about, here are the four elements ranked: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fire</li>
        <li>Lightning</li>
        <li>Blood</li>
        <li>Metal</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Air</li>
        <li>Earth</li>
    </ul>
