        <p>We over here at Peraza Creations made the Drowsy Panda as an expirement within the company to test our
            capabilities for web development.
            Peraza creations has been wanting to enter the web domain as long as I, founder Darwin Peraza could
            remember. This website is a culmination of all of our efforts here at
            Peraza Creations and goes to show how much value we can offer the industry.
