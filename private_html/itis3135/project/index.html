        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>Eco Collective was started as an initiative into expanding the presence of common recycling and educate
            people on the nessecary act of recycling as well as how a customer could participate even at the lowest
            level.
            This initiative was created to enhance the rate of conscious recycling across the globe and to bring
            awarness of how people
            can make change even at the most minute level.</p>
