        <p>When it comes to recycling the reason to recycle have been heavy talking points that have been reused over
            the 21st Century. Pollution has been a hazard to the Earth since the start of the industrial revolutions and
            it has only gotten worse. Animals and plants face most of the brunt when it comes to pollution, with them
            falling victim to the havoc pollution wrecks on the ecosystem causing some species to go extinct. The second
            greatest victim? The planet.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The planet contains many systems in order to keep life on the planet habitable and keep the life within it
            thriving. Greenhouse gases keep the earth warm but due to overpollution due in part to lack of recycling the
            overabundance of greenhouse gases has served the opposite effect making the earth more hostile to the life
            that inhabit it. Along with this the Ozone layer in the atmosphere that serves to protect life from the
            Sun's harmful rays is depleting due to pollution and prevents it from protecting us.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, should those facts not convince you enough even fellow human beings suffer at the hands of
            pollution.
            In different parts of the world, mostly poorer countries, our unrecycled landfill trash gets shipped to
            these countries where the residents also involving children go to rumage through toxic fumes for spare metal
            and parts from unrecycled technology components. This is due in large part to the lack of recycling in the
            technological industry and needs to stop.
