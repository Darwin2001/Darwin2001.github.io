        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>My name is Darwin Peraza and I am a Senior here at the University of North Carolina Charlotte. My interests
            include Gaming and watching Anime, I'm currently into playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and my favorite
            anime series so far is One Piece. One Piece is an amazing show and more people should watch it. When it
            comes to coding I am most used to Java and some Python, although I am open to learning new coding languages.
            I primarily use my Macbook to code but am not adverse to using my Windows desktop to get work done.</p>

        <h3>Personal Background</h3>
        <p>I was born in Nyack NY, and moved down to Matthews NC, when I was 4 years old. So despite being a NY soul i'm
            an NC soul at heart. When it comes to sports however, I am a die hard New York Giants fan and Knicks fan
            when it comes to basketball. Growing up I always had an interest in the internet and computers in general,
            with that reflecting in my interest and now career path. I want to be a software engineer and eventually
            branch out and create my own software all from scratch.</p>

        <h3>Professional and Academic Background</h3>
        <p>I don't have much professional experience, coming transferring from CPCC and trying to catch-up on my degree
            path didn't allow for me to take internship positions. However, the wonderful courses here at UNCC allowed
            me to gain experience in many platforms that are proficient in today's workplace. I have experience with
            Java, Python, and C++, had some experience with html in highschool and I am currently taking a class in
            Mobile Applications, making me somewhat proficient in Android Studio.</p>

        <h3>Current Courses I am taking</h3>
        <p>This semester I am taking a five class course load. The current classes I am taking are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mobile Application</li>
            <li>Software Engineering</li>
            <li>Web App Design</li>
            <li>Intro to AI</li>
            <li>Software Architecture</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>A Funny Tidbit</h3>
        <p>When I was 12 in middle school I went to school with a massive hole in the "rump" area of my shorts. I use to
            get dressed with what was available to me and that morning my clothes hadn't been washed so I was left with
            a pair of shorts at the bottom of the drawer and put them on. I then somehow managed to go through half the
            day with this massive hole in my pants, showing underwear and all without anyone saying anything.</p>
